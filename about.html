                        <p> Hi! I am Maria Nimuel L. Benda√±a, currently living a simple life in Pallocan West Batangas, together with my friends. 
                            But I originally came from Arumahan Lemery Batangas.
                            Here, I am living for twenty years and still counting, enjoying every single of life, looking up and fighting for  big dreams or goals together with my friends.

                    </p>

                    <center><h2> Educational Background</h2> </center>
                    <p> So as of now I am currently a third year student, studying at the Batangas State University, taking up the course of Bachelor of 
                        Science in Information and Technology to achieve the dream of being a professional someday.
                        I am a student that is motivated by love for learning and succeeding as I strive to become an outstanding and successful woman in today's
                        society. Well, choosing this path I know it will be a bumpy ride.  I do not pretend to expect an easy ride throughout my years in college but 
                        I have to believe in myself and to all professors ability and knowledge that will serve as my driver in this ride. But remind the fact that life is
                            not all about succeeding and happiness.
    
                    </p>

                    <p>  Here are some facts about me that you may find interesting! 
                        I am the last born in our family, the youngest and they say the precious one. Well I say precious because my mother was having a hard time 
                        delivering me, it is nearly in the final destination, means of life and death.  Well I can say God is really good because we are kicking and 
                        still alive. I am more fond of watching actions and mystery and thriller than romance, aside from that I choose reading books over going out. Futhermore, I used to dance and draw before as my hobby but as of now I am still not that too motivated to do it again :<
                            And last  BSIT is actually not my first choice to take in college but maybe the psychology or any related to arts and medicine.
