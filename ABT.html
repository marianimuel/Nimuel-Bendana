      <h2> About Me </h2>
      <p> It is a warm sunny day and I am currently living in a simple life in Pallocan West Batangas, together with my friends. 
        But I am originally came from Arumahan Lemery Batangas. I am the last born in our family, the youngest and they say the precious one. Well I say precious because my mother was having a hard time 
        delivering me; it is nearly in the final destination, means of life and death.  Well I can say God is really good because we are kicking and 
        still alive.
         Here I am living for twenty years and still counting, enjoying every single of life, looking up and dream big and high with my friends.</p>

       <h2> Educational Background </h2>
       <p> So as of now I am currently studying at the Batangas State University, taking up the course of Bachelor of 
        Science in Information and Technology to achieve the dream of being a professional someday.
          I am the students that are motivated by love for learning and succeeding as I strive to become an outstanding and successful woman in today's
           society. Well, choosing this path I know it will be a bumpy ride.  I do not pretend to expect an easy ride throughout my years in college but 
           I believe to myself and to all professors ability and knowledge that will serve as my driver in this ride. But here is the fact that life is
            not all about succeeding and happiness. You will just wake up in the day one and see the blue and grey of your life. There are many times
             that i feel the pressure and hardship of adulting  and this path that
          I currently walking on and asking for hands help because you feel down and swallowed by the dark hole.</p>
